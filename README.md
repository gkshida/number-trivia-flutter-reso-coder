# Number Trivia - TDD Clean Architecture for Flutter

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about Clean Architecture for Flutter. We'll be using the Clean Architecture proposed by Bob Martin and the project is proposed by [Reso Coder](https://resocoder.com). Instead of using the Bloc pattern/package we'll be using the Provider package.
